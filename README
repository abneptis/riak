	Abneptis' riak is a from-scratch implementation of the riak client protocol.

## Usage

	For now, please see the tests

## Testing

	Testing is fairly thorough, though patches and additional tests are always
welcome.

	By default, the test-suite will expect a local riak service on :8098 (edit
common_test.go to modify these parameters).	It also will actively work on
riak buckets named 'transientBucket' and 'transientMultiBucket', creating
listing and deleting keys.

	Since riak offers no 'delete bucket' functionality and discourages 'walk-keys'
functionality, the test-suite does not always manage to clean up after itself.
Should this happen, multiple testing runs usually resolve issues, but you
may need to delete the key named after the appropriate test to settle the data
if you are developing changes that break tests.
